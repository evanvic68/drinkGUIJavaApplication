# Java Drink GUI Program

This is an old project created in 2019. It is a graphical user interface program
that simulates a drink stand. The user types in the amount of money that they are
willing to spend and buy the drinks displayed on the screen. 

# New Updates to the Program:

To handle issues with the user typing strings where the program asks for a double
variable, a try-catch methods is needed (this feature has been added). This program
also has problems loading the images of drinks that the user can buy. This issue has
been fixed. There might be issues getting the image to show up in the GUI. Change the
file path in drink.java file to fix this problem.

# More Information

A graphical user interface is a local application that can be run on any computer that
has Java installed. This specifically uses an old framework call Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit).
Other frameworks to use are Java Swing and JavaFX. However, Java is mostly used for testing and 
web applications. Local desktop applications are not in high demand anymore.
